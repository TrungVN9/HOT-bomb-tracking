# HOT-bomb-tracking
This web application utilizing Flask (backend) and React (frontend) allows anonymous users to report events such as bombings, incoming troops, etc. while also dropping a pin at that location. The motivation for creating this application is to help the general public be aware of any nearby dangers so they can prepare accordingly.
